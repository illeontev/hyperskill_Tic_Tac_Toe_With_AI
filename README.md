# hyperskill_Tic_Tac_Toe_With_AI
Tit-Tac-Toe game where you can set the difficulty level. AI in hard mode is unbeatable (due to minimax algorithm)!

At first you should print the command "start %user1 %user2",
where %userN can be "user", "easy", "normal", "hard".

For example, "start user normal".

This command will launch the game where you will have to beat the computer in normal mode.

Command "start normal hard" launches the game where AI in normal mode fights AI in hard mode.

Command "exit" finishes the game.

AI in hard mode uses Minimax algorithm to find the best possible move. There's no way to beat him.
